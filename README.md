# **Makers Clerk**
### **Audience:** The audience for this website will be people in the maker community. The secondary audience would be anyone that needs a materials list to show others how to do their projects.
### **Definition Statement**: I want to create an application that provides an online solution for creating parts lists for maker projects.
### **Elevator Pitch:** Hello, I am Anthony Lopez. I have a bachelor’s degree in History with some graduate coursework. This experience made me very comfortable with research heavy tasks. During graduate school, my research was focused on the digitization and display of oral histories through Omeka. In 2020 Covid-19 made finding work in the field more challenging than ever. In response, I decided to take a break from school and fall back on my passion for computing. In the past, I have edited code for fun and even customized my 3d printer’s firmware using the Marlin framework.  I decided Savvy Coders because they offered an attractive environment for me to learn. For my capstone, I will design a single page application that allows makers to create part lists and export them to PDF.
## List of Pages:
### This app will consist of two pages and a form.
  ### Front: Home Page, Create Form
  ### About Me / Donate”: Links to Social Media, Option for Donations.
### **Description of each Page:**
  ### **Front / Home:** The home page will have the logo and the title of the website on the top of the page (Possible Title: “Maker’s Clerk,”). The page will have two clickable links; one for the form and one for the “About Me / Donate” section.
  ### **Create Form:** The form will feature multiple cells that the user will fill out. Fields will include the part name and model number and links to relevant websites where you can buy the part. (Possible Feature: display photos of the item as well.) There will be three buttons on the page, one for completing the form (On completion the website will process the information and give the option to download the PDF copy), one for returning to the home page, and a clickable link that takes you to the “About Me / Donate” section.
  ### **About Me / Donation:** This page will include clickable links to the Home page, create form, GitHub, and relevant social media. It will also include an option to donate to the Page. (The spirit of the makers community has always been to broaden knowledge. For that reason, participants hardly ever ask for services to cost something per use. It is much more common for community members to ask for donations.)
